The files, "css-*.js", were generated from ometajs grammars, using 
ometajs (https://github.com/veged/ometa-js).  The files were then
modified slightly, by hand, so that they will run in a web browser
using an AMD loader.

Also, the requisite runtime scripts were copied from the ometajs, 
project into the local dir, "ometajs/runtime". These scripts were
also "doctored" by hand, to support the AMD loader environment.
