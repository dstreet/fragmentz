## Code Generation (NB)
The grammars (*.ometajs) in this directory can be built with ometajs
the executable for which is linked from the `bin/` directory. ometajs
requires a working install of nodejs.

The Makefile will build `.js` files from the `.ometajs` files.
Unfortunately, these js files are not ready, "out of the box", for 
use in a browser.  

For now, the conversion process is manual.  Minor changes need to 
be made to the require statements; and each module needs to wrapped
for AMD.  If you just copy the generated js files into the parent
directory, without making the necessary changes, **it won't work**. 

Also, a few supporting scripts are required from ometajs, in order 
for the compiled grammars to work at runtime.  It's expected that 
these scripts will be copied manually, into the appropriate location 
in the web project, as part of the conversion process. (the necessary
scripts have already been copied, and are located in ../ometajs/runtime).


## A Note on the Grammars Themselves
The grammars were taken wholesale from (cssp)[https://github.com/css/cssp].
These grammars are not really fully correct, and need to be 
re-written to match the (css spec)[http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html].
As it stands, the cssp grammars will parse fully valid CSS.  However,
they fail to parse invalid CSS, which is a violation of the spec.  It's
also a particularly annoying non-feature for a translator like this.
